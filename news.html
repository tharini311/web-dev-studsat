<br>
<p>Today, 23rd June 2022 @ 03.20 Hrs IST, NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a CPSE under Department of Space, successfully undertook the launch of GSAT-24 communication satellite on-board Ariane-V [VA257 flight] from Kourou, French Guiana. The VA257 flight in addition to GSAT-24 satellite of India also carried Measat-3d communication satellite from Malaysia as other co-passenger

GSAT-24 is a 24 Ku band communication satellite meant for meeting the Direct-To-Home (DTH) communication needs of the country. Satellite weighed 4180 kg at lift-off and has mission life of 15 years. NSIL has leased the entire satellite capacity to M/s Tata Play for a period of 15 years.  The entire funding for the GSAT-24 mission has been borne by NSIL.

After nearly 40 minutes of flight, GSAT-24 satellite was successfully injected into its intended Geo-Synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with Perigee: 250 km and Apogee: 35825 km.  

Post-separation of GSAT-24 satellite, ISRO's Master Control Facility at Hassan, Karnataka took control of the satellite and initial data received indicates good health of the satellite. In the coming days, the orbit of GSAT-24 satellite would be raised from GTO to Geo-Stationary Orbit (GSO), through a series of orbit raising manoeuvres using satellite’s on-board propulsion system.  

“Today’s successful mission of GSAT-24 is a major step forward for NSIL in commercially meeting the DTH communication needs of the country using indigenously built satellite solutions from ISRO,” Dr S Somanath, Secretary DOS said.

With the successful launch of GSAT-24, NSIL will be owning and operating nearly 11 Communication Satellites in-orbit and would meet the bulk of the communication needs of the country.  GSAT-24 is the first of the many Demand Driven Missions, that NSIL would undertake in the coming years.</p>

<h2>ISRO successfully demonstrates new technology with Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (IAD) – a game changer with multiple applications for future missions.</h2><br>
<h5>Sept 03,2022</h5>

<br>
<p>An IAD, designed and developed by VSSC, has been successfully test flown in a Rohini sounding rocket from TERLS,Thumba at 12.20 pm today. The IAD was initially folded and kept inside the payload bay of the rocket. At around 84 km altitude, the IAD was inflated and it descended through atmosphere with the payload part of sounding rocket. The pneumatic system for inflation was developed by LPSC. The IAD has systematically reduced the velocity of the payload through aerodynamic drag and followed the predicted trajectory. This is first time that an IAD is designed specifically for spent stage recovery. All the objectives of the mission were successfully demonstrated

The IAD has huge potential in variety of space applications like recovery of spent stages of rocket, for landing payloads on to Mars or Venus and in making space habitat for human space flight missions.

Rohini sounding rockets are routinely used for flight demonstration of new technologies being developed by ISRO as well as by scientists from India and abroad. In today’s flight, along with IAD new elements like micro video imaging system which captured the bloom and flight of IAD, a miniature software defined radio telemetry transmitter, MEMS based acoustic sensor and a host of new methodologies were flight tested successfully. These will be inducted later to the major missions. Sounding rockets offers an exciting platform for experimentation in upper atmosphere.

"This demonstration opens a gateway for cost effective spent stage recovery using the Inflatable Aerodynamics Decelerator technology and this IAD technology can also be used in ISRO's future missions to Venus and Mars" said Shri S Somanath, Chairman ISRO, Secretary DOS who witnessed the launch.

The launch was also witnessed by senior dignitaries of ISRO including Dr S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC and Dr V Narayanan, Director, LPSC.</p>

<h2>ISRO successfully tests large human rated solid rocket booster for the Gaganyaan programme</h2><br>
<h5>May 13,2022</h5>

<br>
<p>ISRO successfully completed the static test of a human-rated solid rocket booster (HS200) for the Gaganyaan Programme at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh on May 13, 2022, at 7:20 AM local time. HS200 rocket booster is the human-rated version of the well-proven S200 rocket booster of GSLV Mk III satellite launch vehicle, popularly known as LVM3. The successful completion of this test marks a major milestone for the prestigious human space flight mission of ISRO, the Gaganyaan, as the first stage of the launch vehicle is tested for its performance for the full duration. The event was witnessed by Shri S Somanath, Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, Department of Space and Dr. S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC along with other ISRO scientists. Design and development of the HS200 booster were completed at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram and propellant casting was completed at SDSC, Sriharikota.


The S200 motor which is the first stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle intended for launching a 4000 kg class of satellites to Geosynchronous transfer orbit, was configured as a strap-on rocket booster. Based on the successful launch pedigree of this launch vehicle including the Chandrayaan mission, the LVM3 has been identified as the launcher for the Gaganyaan mission. For the manned space mission, LVM3 launch vehicle underwent improvements stipulated by the requirements of human rating. Accordingly, a host of design improvements that were aimed at increasing the safety and reliability of various systems were implemented in the S200 booster like all other systems.  These include additional safety features for motor case joints and robust insulation and ignition systems. The control system used in this booster employs one of the world’s most powerful electro-mechanical actuators with multiple redundancies and safety features. The system is fully indigenously designed and developed by ISRO in participation with various industries spread across the country. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, ISRO could complete the entire design, development, realization and testing process within a short span of two years.


The HS200 booster loaded with 203 tons of solid propellant was tested for a duration of 135 seconds.  The 20 m long and 3.2 m diameter booster is the world’s second-largest operational booster with solid propellant. During this test, about 700 parameters were monitored and the performance of all the systems was normal. With the successful completion of this test, ISRO marches one more step closer to Gaganyaan Programme. Out of the three propulsion stages of LVM3, the human-rated versions of the second stage known as L110-G loaded with liquid propellant and the third stage C25-G with cryogenic propellant are in the final phase of qualification including tests with static firing. Gaganyaan programme, the most prestigious scientific endeavour of India is steadily progressing towards its final goal of taking an Indian to space and bringing him safely back.</p>
