      <p>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was developed to launch Low Earth Orbit satellites into Polar and Sun Synchronous Orbits. It has since proved its versatility by launching Geosynchronous, Lunar and Interplanetary spacecraft successfully.<br>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is the third generation launch vehicle of India. It is the first Indian launch vehicle to be equipped with liquid stages. After its first successful launch in October 1994, PSLV emerged as the reliable and versatile workhorse launch vehicle of India with 39 consecutively successful missions by June 2017. During 1994-2017 period, the vehicle has launched 48 Indian satellites and 209 satellites for customers from abroad.

Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two spacecraft – Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in 2013 – that later traveled to Moon and Mars respectively.

      <p>Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle was developed to launch the heavier INSAT class of Geosynchronous satellites into orbit. In its third and final stage, GSLV uses the indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage.<br>
      Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II) is the largest launch vehicle developed by India, which is currently in operation. This fourth generation launch vehicle is a three stage vehicle with four liquid strap-ons. The indigenously developed cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), which is flight proven, forms the third stage of GSLV Mk II. From January 2014, the vehicle has achieved four consecutive successes.</p>

      <p>The Centre for Space Research is a recent initiative at NMIT. The objective at the Centre is to carry out Research and Development for Design and Development of a nano-satellite for Earth Observation. The satellite will help with Disaster Management, Low Earth Orbit Communication System, Quantum Satellite Communication, Novel Efficient Telemetry System Development, Space Debris Management and Outer Space Environmental Studies. The research also focuses on innovative sensor development for atmospheric studies, outer space studies through femto-satellite development or satellite-on-chip programs. Through this effort, NMIT would like to participate in ISRO’s capacity development to provide innovative services and trained human resources for national and international space programs.</p>
